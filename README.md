# Drone Circus user interface


To initialize the program, 
1. Connect to Tello Wi-Fi
2. Execute circus.py


# [IMPORTANT!] If this error shows after installing requirements.txt:

AttributeError: partially initialized module 'cv2' has no attribute 'gapi_wip_gst_GStreamerPipeline' (most likely due to a circular import)

--> Delete all open-cv packages installed and then install the required version of open-cv again.

It should be only ONE package of open-cv installed.
